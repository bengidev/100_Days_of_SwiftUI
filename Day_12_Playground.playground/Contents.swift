/// How to create your own classes
///
/// Swift uses structs for storing most of its data types, including String, Int, Double, and
/// Array, but there is another way to create custom data types called classes. These have many
/// things in common with structs, but are different in key places.
///
/// First, the things that classes and structs have in common include.
/// - You get to create and name them.
/// - You can add properties and methods, including property observers and access control.
/// - You can create custom initializers to configure new instances however you want.
///
/// However, classes differ from structs in five key places.
/// - You can make one class build upon functionality in another class, gaining all its properties
///     and methods as a starting point. If you want to selectively override some methods,
///     you can do that too.
/// - Because of that first point, Swift won’t automatically generate a memberwise initializer
///     for classes. This means you either need to write your own initializer, or assign default
///     values to all your properties.
/// - When you copy an instance of a class, both copies share the same data – if you change
///     one copy, the other one also changes.
/// - When the final copy of a class instance is destroyed, Swift can optionally run
///     a special function called a deinitializer.
/// - Even if you make a class constant, you can still change its properties as long as
///     they are variables.
///
/// On the surface those probably seem fairly random, and there’s a good chance you’re probably
/// wondering why classes are even needed when we already have structs.
///

/// However, SwiftUI uses classes extensively, mainly for point 3: all copies of a class share
/// the same data. This means many parts of your app can share the same information, so that if
/// the user changed their name in one screen all the other screens would automatically update
/// to reflect that change.
///
/// The other points matter, but are of varying use.
/// - Being able to build one class based on another is really important in Apple’s older UI
///     framework, UIKit, but is much less common in SwiftUI apps. In UIKit it was common to have
///     long class hierarchies, where class A was built on class B, which was built on class C,
///     which was built on class D, etc.
/// - Lacking a memberwise initializer is annoying, but hopefully you can see why it would be
///     tricky to implement given that one class can be based upon another – if class C added
///     an extra property it would break all the initializers for C, B, and A.
/// - Being able to change a constant class’s variables links in to the multiple copy behavior
///     of classes: a constant class means we can’t change what pot our copy points to,
///     but if the properties are variable we can still change the data inside the pot.
///     This is different from structs, where each copy of a struct is unique and
///     holds its own data.
/// - Because one instance of a class can be referenced in several places, it becomes important
///     to know when the final copy has been destroyed. That’s where the deinitializer comes in:
///     it allows us to clean up any special resources we allocated when that last copy goes away.
///

/// Before we’re done, let’s look at just a tiny slice of code that creates and uses a class.
///
class Game {
    var score = 0 {
        didSet {
            print("Score is now \(score)")
            print()
        }
    }
}

var newGame = Game()
newGame.score += 10

/// Yes, the only difference between that and a struct is that it was created using class
/// rather than struct – everything else is identical. That might make classes seem redundant,
/// but trust Hacking With Swift: all five of their differences are important.
///
/// Hacking With Swift will be going into more detail on the five differences between classes and
/// structs in the following chapters, but right now the most important thing to know is this:
/// structs are important, and so are classes – you will need both when using SwiftUI.
///

/// Why does Swift have both classes and structs?
///
/// Classes and structs give Swift developers the ability to create custom, complex types with
/// properties and methods, but they have five important differences.
/// - Classes do not come with synthesized memberwise initializers.
/// - One class can be built upon (“inherit from”) another class, gaining its properties and
///     methods.
/// - Copies of structs are always unique, whereas copies of classes actually point
///     to the same shared data.
/// - Classes have deinitializers, which are methods that are called when an instance of the class
///     is destroyed, but structs do not.
/// - Variable properties in constant classes can be modified freely, but variable properties
///     in constant structs cannot.
///
/// Hacking With Swift will explain these differences in more detail soon, but the point is
/// that they exist and that they matter. Most Swift developers prefer to use structs rather than
/// classes when possible, which means when you choose a class over a struct you’re doing so
/// because you want one of the above behaviors.
///

/// Why don’t Swift classes have a memberwise initializer?
///
/// One of the many useful features of Swift’s struct is that they come with a synthesized
/// memberwise initializer, letting us create new instances of the struct just by specifying
/// its properties. However, Swift’s classes don’t have this feature, which is annoying – but why
/// don’t they have it?
///
/// The main reason is that classes have inheritance, which would make memberwise initializers
/// difficult to work with. Think about it: if Hacking With Swift built a class
/// that you inherited from, then added some properties to my class later on, your code would
/// break – all those places you relied on Hacking With Swift memberwise initializer
/// would suddenly no longer work.
///
/// So, Swift has a simple solution: rather than automatically generating a memberwise
/// initializer, authors of classes must write their own initializer by hand. This way,
/// you can add properties as much as you want without affecting the initializer for your class,
/// and affecting others who inherit from your class. And when you do decide to change
/// your initializer, you’re doing so yourself, and are therefore fully aware
/// of the implications for any inheriting classes.
///





/// How to make one class inherit from another
///
/// Swift lets us create classes by basing them on existing classes, which is a process known as
/// inheritance. When one class inherits functionality from another class (its “parent” or
/// “super” class), Swift will give the new class access (the “child class” or “subclass”) to the
/// properties and methods from that parent class, allowing us to make small additions or
/// changes to customize the way the new class behaves.
///
/// To make one class inherit from another, write a colon after the child class’s name,
/// then add the parent class’s name. For example, here is an Employee class with one property
/// and an initializer.
///
class Employee {
    let hours: Int
    
    init(hours: Int) {
        self.hours = hours
    }
}

/// We could make two subclasses of Employee, each of which will gain the hours property
/// and initializer.
///
/// Notice how those two child classes can refer directly to hours – it’s as if they added
/// that property themselves, except we don’t have to keep repeating ourselves.
///
class Developer: Employee {
    func work() -> Void {
        print("I'm writing code for \(hours) hours.")
        print()
    }
}

class Manager: Employee {
    func work() -> Void {
        print("I'm going to meetings for \(hours) hours.")
        print()
    }
}

/// Each of those classes inherit from Employee, but each then adds their own customization.
/// So, if we create an instance of each and call work(), we’ll get a different result.
///
let robert = Developer(hours: 8)
let joseph = Manager(hours: 10)
robert.work()
joseph.work()

/// As well as sharing properties, you can also share methods, which can then be called
/// from the child classes. As an example, try adding this to the Employee class.
///
class Employee1 {
    let hours: Int
    
    init(hours: Int) {
        self.hours = hours
    }
    
    func printSummary() -> Void {
        print("I work \(hours) hours a day.")
        print()
    }
}

class Developer1: Employee1 {
    func work() -> Void {
        print("I'm writing code for \(hours) hours.")
        print()

class Manager1: Employee1 {
    func work() -> Void {
        print("I'm going to meetings for \(hours) hours.")
        print()
    }
}

/// Because Developer inherits from Employee, we can immediately start calling printSummary()
/// on instances of Developer, like this.
///
let novall = Developer1(hours: 8)
novall.printSummary()

/// Things get a little more complicated when you want to change a method you inherited.
/// For example, we just put printSummary() into Employee, but maybe one of those child classes
/// wants slightly different behavior.
///
/// This is where Swift enforces a simple rule: if a child class wants to change a method
/// from a parent class, you must use override in the child class’s version. This does two things.
/// - If you attempt to change a method without using override, Swift will refuse to build
///     your code. This stops you accidentally overriding a method.
/// - If you use override but your method doesn’t actually override something from
///     the parent class, Swift will refuse to build your code because you probably made a mistake.
///

/// So, if we wanted developers to have a unique printSummary() method, we’d add this
/// to the Developer class.
///
class Employee2 {
    let hours: Int
    
    init(hours: Int) {
        self.hours = hours

/// Swift is smart about how method overrides work: if your parent class has a work() method
/// that returns nothing, but the child class has a work() method that accepts a string
/// to designate where the work is being done, that does not require override because you aren’t
/// replacing the parent method.
///
/// If you know for sure that your class should not support inheritance, you can mark it as final.
/// This means the class itself can inherit from other things, but can’t be used to inherit from –
/// no child class can use a final class as its parent.
///

/// When would you want to override a method?
///
/// In Swift, any class that inherits from a parent class can override the methods and sometimes
/// the properties of that parent class, which means they can replace the parent’s method
/// implementation with one of their own.
///
/// This level of customization is really important, and makes our lives easier as developers.
/// Think about it: if someone has designed a brilliant class that you want to use, but it isn’t
/// quite right, wouldn’t it be nice to just override one part of its behavior rather than
/// having to rewrite the whole thing yourself?
///
/// Sure it would, and that’s exactly where method overriding comes in: you can keep
/// all the behavior you want, and just change one or two little parts in a custom subclass.
///
/// In UIKit, Apple’s original user interface framework for iOS, this approach was used a lot.
/// For example, consider some of the built-in apps such as Settings and Messages. Both of these
/// present information in rows: Settings has rows such as General, Control Center, Display &
/// Brightness, and so on, and Messages has individual rows for each conversation you’ve had
/// with different people. In UIKit these are called tables, and they have some common behavior:
/// you can scroll through all the rows, you can tap on the rows to select one, there are
/// little gray arrows on the right side of the rows, and so on.
///
/// These lists of rows are very common, so Apple provided us existing code to use them that has
/// all that standard behavior built right in. Of course, there are some bits that actually need
/// to change, such as how many rows the lists have and what content they have inside. So, Swift
/// developers would create subclasses of Apple’s table and override the parts they wanted
/// to change, giving them all the built-in functionality and lots of flexibility and control.
///
/// Swift makes us use the override keyword before overriding functions, which is really helpful.
/// - If you use it when it isn’t needed (because the parent class doesn’t declare the same
///     method) then you’ll get an error. This stops you from mistyping things, such as parameter
///     names or types, and also stops your override from failing if the parent class changes
///     its method and you don’t follow suit.
/// - If you don’t use it when it is needed, then you’ll also get an error. This stops you from
///     accidentally changing behavior from the parent class.
///

/// Which classes should be declared as final?
///
/// Final classes are ones that cannot be inherited from, which means it’s not possible for users
/// of your code to add functionality or change what they have. This is not the default:
/// you must opt in to this behavior by adding the final keyword to your class.
///
/// Remember, anyone who subclasses your class can override your properties and perhaps also
/// your methods, which offers them incredible power. If you do something they don’t like, bam –
/// they can just replace that. They might still call your original method as well as their
/// replacement, but they might not.
///
/// This can be problematic: perhaps your class does something really important that mustn’t
/// be replaced, or perhaps you have clients on a support contract and you don’t want them
/// breaking the way your code works.
///
/// Much of Apple’s own code was written before Swift came along, in an earlier language called
/// Objective-C. Objective-C didn’t have great support for final classes, so Apple usually
/// resorted to large warnings on their site. For example, there’s a very important class
/// called AVPlayerViewController that is designed to play movies, and its documentation page
/// has a large yellow warning saying: “Subclassing AVPlayerViewController and overriding its
/// methods isn’t supported, and results in undefined behavior.” We don’t know why, only that we
/// shouldn’t do it. There’s another class called Timer that handles timed events like an alarm,
/// and there the warning is even simpler: “Do not subclass Timer”.
///
/// In Swift it used to be the case that final classes were more performant than non-final
/// classes, because we were providing a little bit more information about how our code would run
/// and Swift would use that to make some optimizations.
///
/// That hasn’t been true for a while, but even today Hacking With Swift think many people
/// instinctively declare their classes as final to mean “you shouldn’t subclass from this unless
/// Hacking With Swift specifically allow it.” Hacking With Swift certainly do this a lot, because
/// it’s another way Hacking With Swift can help folks understand how Hacking With Swift code
/// works.
///





/// How to add initializers for classes
///
/// Class initializers in Swift are more complicated than struct initializers, but with a little
/// cherrypicking we can focus on the part that really matters: if a child class has any custom
/// initializers, it must always call the parent’s initializer after it has finished setting up
/// its own properties, if it has any.
///
/// Like I said previously, Swift won’t automatically generate a memberwise initializer for
/// classes. This applies with or without inheritance happening – it will never generate
/// a memberwise initializer for you. So, you either need to write your own initializer,
/// or provide default values for all the properties of the class.
///

/// Let’s start by defining a new class.
///
/// That has a single Boolean property, plus an initializer to set the value for that property.
/// Remember, using self here makes it clear we’re assigning the isElectric parameter
/// to the property of the same name.
///
class Vehicle {
    let isElectric: Bool
    
    init(isElectric: Bool) {
        self.isElectric = isElectric
    }
}

/// Now, let’s say we wanted to make a Car class inheriting from Vehicle – you might start out
/// writing something like this.
/// But Swift will refuse to build that code: we’ve said that the Vehicle class needs to know
/// whether it’s electric or not, but we haven’t provided a value for that.
///
//class Car: Vehicle {
//    let isConvertible: Bool
//
//    init(isConvertible: Bool) {
//        self.isConvertible = isConvertible
//    }
//}

/// What Swift wants us to do is provide Car with an initializer that includes both isElectric and
/// isConvertible, but rather than trying to store isElectric ourselves we instead need to pass
/// it on – we need to ask the super class to run its own initializer.
///
/// Here’s how that looks.
/// super is another one of those values that Swift automatically provides for us, similar to
/// self: it allows us to call up to methods that belong to our parent class, such as its
/// initializer. You can use it with other methods if you want; it’s not limited to initializers.
///
/// If a subclass does not have any of its own initializers, it automatically inherits
/// the initializers of its parent class.
///
class Car: Vehicle {
    let isConvertible: Bool
    
    init(isElectric: Bool, isConvertible: Bool) {
        self.isConvertible = isConvertible
        super.init(isElectric: isElectric)
    }
}

/// Now that we have a valid initializer in both our classes, we can make an instance of Car
/// like so.
///
let teslaX = Car(isElectric: true, isConvertible: true)





/// How to copy classes
///
/// In Swift, all copies of a class instance share the same data, meaning that any changes
/// you make to one copy will automatically change the other copies. This happens because classes
/// are reference types in Swift, which means all copies of a class all refer back to the same
/// underlying pot of data.
///

/// To see this in action, try this simple class.
///
/// That has just one property, but because it’s stored inside a class it will get shared
/// across all copies of the class.
///
class User {
    var username = "Anonymous"
}

/// So, we could create an instance of that class.
///
var user1 = User()

/// We could then take a copy of user1 and change the username value.
///
/// hacking With Swift hope you see where this is going! Now we’ve changed the copy’s username
/// property we can then print out the same properties from each different copy.
///
/// And that’s going to print “Taylor” for both – even though we only changed
/// one of the instances, the other also changed.
///
var user2 = user1
user2.username = "Taylor"

print(user1.username)
print(user2.username)
print()

/// This might seem like a bug, but it’s actually a feature – and a really important feature too,
/// because it’s what allows us to share common data across all parts of our app. As you’ll see,
/// SwiftUI relies very heavily on classes for its data, specifically because they can be shared
/// so easily.
///
/// In comparison, structs do not share their data amongst copies, meaning that if we change
/// class User to struct User in our code we get a different result: it will print “Anonymous”
/// then “Taylor”, because changing the copy didn’t also adjust the original.
///

/// If you want to create a unique copy of a class instance – sometimes called a deep copy –
/// you need to handle creating a new instance and copy across all your data safely.
///
/// In our case that’s straightforward.
///
/// Now we can safely call copy() to get an object with the same starting data, but any future
/// changes won’t impact the original.
///
class User1 {
    var username = "Anonymous"
    
    func copy() -> User1 {
        let user = User1()
        user.username = username
        return user
    }
}

var user3 = User1()
var user4 = user3.copy()
user4.username = "Taylor"

print(user3.username)
print(user4.username)
print()

/// Why do copies of a class share their data?
///
/// One feature of Swift that is truly confusing at first is how the behaviors of its classes and
/// structs differ when they are copied: copies of the same class share their underlying data,
/// meaning that changing one changes them all, whereas structs always have their own unique data,
/// and changing a copy does not affect the others.
///
/// The technical term for this distinction is “value types vs reference types.” Structs are
/// value types, which means they hold simple values such as the number 5 or the string “hello”.
/// It doesn’t matter how many properties or methods your struct has, it’s still considered
/// one simple value like a number. On the other hand, classes are reference types,
/// which means they refer to a value somewhere else.
///

/// For value types, this is easy enough to understand that it’s self-evident.
/// For example, look at this code.
///
/// When that code runs, message will still be set to “Welcome”, but greeting will be set
/// to “Hello”. As Chris Eidhof says, “this is so natural it seems like stating the obvious.”
/// But that’s how structs behave: their value are wholly contained inside their variable,
/// and not somehow shared with other values. This means all their data is stored directly
/// in each variable, so when you copy it you get a deep copy of all the data.
///
var message = "Welcome"
var greeting = message
greeting = "Hello"

print(message)
print(greeting)
print()

/// In contrast, the best way to think about a reference type is that it’s like a signpost
/// pointing to some data. If we create an instance of a class, it will take up some memory
/// on your iPhone, and the variable that stores the instance is really just a signpost to the
/// actual memory where the object lives. If you take a copy of the object, you get a new
/// signpost but it still points to the memory where the original object lives. This is why
/// changing one instance of a class changes them all: all copies of the object are signposts
/// pointing to the same piece of memory.
///

/// It’s hard to overestimate how important this difference is in Swift development. Previously
/// Hacking With Swift mentioned that Swift developers prefer to use structs for their custom
/// types, and this copy behavior is a big reason. Imagine if you had a big app and wanted
/// to share a User object in various places – what would happen if one of those places
/// changed your user? If you were using a class, all the other places that used your user
/// would have their data changed without realizing it, and you might end up with problems.
/// But if you were using a struct, every part of your app has its own copy of the data and
/// it can’t be changed by surprise.
///
/// As with many things in programming, the choices you make should help convey a little
/// of your reasoning. In this case, using a class rather than a struct sends a strong message
/// that you want the data to be shared somehow, rather than having lots of distinct copies.
///





/// How to create a deinitializer for a class
///
/// Swift’s classes can optionally be given a deinitializer, which is a bit like the opposite
/// of an initializer in that it gets called when the object is destroyed rather than
/// when it’s created.
///
/// This comes with a few small provisos.
/// - Just like initializers, you don’t use func with deinitializers – they are special.
/// - Deinitializers can never take parameters or return data, and as a result aren’t
///     even written with parentheses.
/// - Your deinitializer will automatically be called when the final copy of a class instance
///     is destroyed. That might mean it was created inside a function that is now finishing,
///     for example.
/// - We never call deinitializers directly; they are handled automatically by the system.
/// - Structs don’t have deinitializers, because you can’t copy them.
///

/// Exactly when your deinitializers are called depends on what you’re doing, but really it comes
/// down to a concept called scope. Scope more or less means “the context where information
/// is available”, and you’ve seen lots of examples already.
/// - If you create a variable inside a function, you can’t access it from outside the function.
/// - If you create a variable inside an if condition, that variable is not available
///     outside the condition.
/// - If you create a variable inside a for loop, including the loop variable itself,
///     you can’t use it outside the loop.
///
/// If you look at the big picture, you’ll see each of those use braces to create their scope:
/// conditions, loops, and functions all create local scopes.
///

/// When a value exits scope we mean the context it was created in is going away. In the case of
/// structs that means the data is being destroyed, but in the case of classes it means only one
/// copy of the underlying data is going away – there might still be other copies elsewhere.
/// But when the final copy goes away – when the last constant or variable pointing at a class
/// instance is destroyed – then the underlying data is also destroyed, and the memory
/// it was using is returned back to the system.
///

/// To demonstrate this, we could create a class that prints a message when it’s created and
/// destroyed, using an initializer and deinitializer.
///
class User2 {
    let id: Int
    
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("User \(id): I'm dead!")
        print()
    }
}
    
/// Now we can create and destroy instances of that quickly using a loop – if we create a User
/// instance inside the loop, it will be destroyed when the loop iteration finishes.
///
/// When that code runs you’ll see it creates and destroys each user individually, with one
/// being destroyed fully before another is even created.
///
for i in 1...3 {
    let user = User2(id: i)
    print("User \(user.id): I'm in control!")
    print()
}

/// Remember, the deinitializer is only called when the last remaining reference to a class
/// instance is destroyed. This might be a variable or constant you have stashed away,
/// or perhaps you stored something in an array.
///
/// For example, if we were adding our User instances as they were created, they would only
/// be destroyed when the array is cleared.
///
var users = [User2]()

for i in 1...3 {
    let user = User2(id: i)
    print("User \(user.id): I'm in control!")
    print()
    
    users.append(user)
}

print("Loop is finished!")
users.removeAll()
print("Array is clear!")
print()

/// Why do classes have deinitializers and structs don’t?
///
/// One small but important feature of classes is that they can have a deinitializer function –
/// a counterpart to init() that gets run when the class instance gets destroyed.
/// Structs don’t have deinitializers, which means we can’t tell when they are destroyed.
///
/// The job of deinitializers is to tell us when a class instance was destroyed. For structs
/// this is fairly simple: the struct is destroyed when whatever owns it no longer exists.
/// So, if we create a struct inside a method and the methods ends, the struct is destroyed.
///
/// However, classes have complex copying behavior that means several copies of the class can
/// exist in various parts of your program. All the copies point to the same underlying data,
/// and so it’s now much harder to tell when the actual class instance is destroyed –
/// when the final variable pointing to it has gone away.
///
/// Behind the scenes Swift performs something called automatic reference counting, or ARC.
/// ARC tracks how many copies of each class instance exists: every time you take a copy
/// of a class instance Swift adds 1 to its reference count, and every time a copy is destroyed
/// Swift subtracts 1 from its reference count. When the count reaches 0 it means no one refers
/// to the class any more, and Swift will call its deinitializer and destroy the object.
///
/// So, the simple reason for why structs don’t have deinitializers is because they don’t need
/// them: each struct has its own copy of its data, so nothing special needs to happen
/// when it is destroyed.
///
/// You can put your deinitializer anywhere you want in your code, but I love this quote from
/// Anne Cahalan: “Code should read like sentences, which makes me think my classes should read
/// like chapters. So the deinitializer goes at the end, it's the ~fin~ of the class!”
///





/// How to work with variables inside classes
///
/// Swift’s classes work a bit like signposts: every copy of a class instance we have is actually
/// a signpost pointing to the same underlying piece of data. Mostly this matters because of
/// the way changing one copy changes all the others, but it also matters because of
/// how classes treat variable properties.
///

/// This one small code sample demonstrates how things work.
///
/// That creates a constant User instance, but then changes it – it changes the constant value.
/// That’s bad, right?

/// Except it doesn’t change the constant value at all. Yes, the data inside the class has

/// Think of it like this: we created a constant signpoint pointing towards a user, but we erased

/// Now, if we had made the name property a constant using let, then it could not be changed –
/// we have a constant signpost pointing to a user, but we’ve written their name in permanent ink
/// so that it can’t be erased.
///
/// In contrast, what happens if we made both the user instance and the name property variables?
/// Now we’d be able to change the property, but we’d also be able to change to a wholly new User
/// instance if we wanted. To continue the signpost analogy, it would be like turning the signpost
/// to point at wholly different person.
///
/// Try it with this code.
///
/// That would end up printing “Paul”, because even though we changed name to “Taylor” we then
/// overwrote the whole user object with a new one, resetting it back to “Paul”.

/// The final variation is having a variable instance and constant properties, which would mean
/// we can create a new User if we want, but once it’s done we can’t change its properties.
///
/// So, we end up with four options.
/// - Constant instance, constant property – a signpost that always points to the same user,
///     who always has the same name.
/// - Constant instance, variable property – a signpost that always points to the same user,
///     but their name can change.
/// - Variable instance, constant property – a signpost that can point to different users,
///     but their names never change.
/// - Variable instance, variable property – a signpost that can point to different users,
///     and those users can also change their names.
///
/// This might seem awfully confusing, and perhaps even pedantic. However, it serves an important
/// purpose because of the way class instances get shared.
///

/// Let’s say you’ve been given a User instance. Your instance is constant, but the property
/// inside was declared as a variable. This tells you not only that you can change that property
/// if you want to, but more importantly tells you there’s the possibility of the property being
/// changed elsewhere – that class you have could be a copy from somewhere else, and because
/// the property is variable it means some other part of code could change it by surprise.
///
/// When you see constant properties it means you can be sure neither your current code nor
/// any other part of your program can change it, but as soon as you’re dealing with variable
/// properties – regardless of whether the class instance itself is constant or not – it opens up
/// the possibility that the data could change under your feet.
///
/// This is different from structs, because constant structs cannot have their properties changed
/// even if the properties were made variable. Hopefully you can now see why this happens:
/// structs don’t have the whole signpost thing going on, they hold their data directly.
/// This means if you try to change a value inside the struct you’re also implicitly changing
/// the struct itself, which isn’t possible because it’s constant.
///
/// One upside to all this is that classes don’t need to use the mutating keyword with methods
/// that change their data. This keyword is really important for structs because constant structs
/// cannot have their properties changed no matter how they were created, so when Swift sees us
/// calling a mutating method on a constant struct instance it knows that shouldn’t be allowed.
///
/// With classes, how the instance itself was created no longer matters – the only thing that
/// determines whether a property can be modified or not is whether the property itself
/// was created as a constant. Swift can see that for itself just by looking at how you made
/// the property, so there’s no more need to mark the method specially.
///

/// Why can variable properties in constant classes be changed?
///
/// One of the small but important differences between structs and classes is the way they handle
/// mutability of properties.
/// - Variable classes can have variable properties changed
/// - Constant classes can have variable properties changed
/// - Variable structs can have variable properties changed
/// - Constant structs cannot have variable properties changed
///

/// The reason for this lies in the fundamental difference between a class and a struct:
/// one points to some data in memory, whereas the other is one value such as the number 5.
///
/// Consider code such as this.
///
/// We can’t simply define the number 5 to be 6, because that wouldn’t make sense – it would break
/// everything we know about mathematics. Instead, that code removes the existing value
/// assigned to number and gives it the number 6 instead.
///
var number = 5
number = 6

/// That’s how structs work in Swift: when we change one of its properties, we are in fact
/// changing the entire struct. Sure, behind the scenes Swift can do some optimization so that
/// it isn’t really throwing away the whole value every time we change just one part of it,
/// but that’s how it’s treated from our perspective.
///
/// So, if changing one part of a struct effectively means destroying and recreating the entire
/// struct, hopefully you can see why constant structs don’t allow their variable properties
/// to be changed – it would mean destroying and recreating something that is supposed
/// to be constant, which isn’t possible.
///
/// Classes don’t work this way: you can change any part of their properties without having
/// to destroy and recreate the value. As a result, constant classes can have their variable
/// properties changed freely.
///





/// Summary: Classes
///
/// Classes aren’t quite as commonly used as structs, but they serve an invaluable purpose
/// for sharing data, and if you ever choose to learn Apple’s older UIKit framework you’ll find
/// yourself using them extensively.
///
/// Let’s recap what we learned.
/// - Classes have lots of things in common with structs, including the ability to have properties
///     and methods, but there are five key differences between classes and structs.
/// - First, classes can inherit from other classes, which means they get access to the properties
///     and methods of their parent class. You can optionally override methods in child classes
///     if you want, or mark a class as being final to stop others subclassing it.
/// - Second, Swift doesn’t generate a memberwise initializer for classes, so you need to do it
///     yourself. If a subclass has its own initializer, it must always call the parent class’s
///     initializer at some point.
/// - Third, if you create a class instance then take copies of it, all those copies point back
///     to the same instance. This means changing some data in one of the copies changes them all.
/// - Fourth, classes can have deinitializers that run when the last copy of one instance
///     is destroyed.
/// - Finally, variable properties inside class instances can be changed regardless of whether
///     the instance itself was created as variable.
