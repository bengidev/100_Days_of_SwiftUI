/// How to create and use protocols
///
/// Protocols are a bit like contracts in Swift: they let us define what kinds of functionality
/// we expect a data type to support, and Swift ensures that the rest of our code follows
/// those rules.
///
/// Think about how we might write some code to simulate someone commuting from their home
/// to their office. We might create a small Car struct, then write a function like this.
///
//func commute(distance: Int, using vehicle: Car) -> Void {
//    // Lots of code here
//}

/// Of course, they might also commute by train, so we’d also write this.
///
//func commute(distance: Int, using vehicle: Train) -> Void {
//    // Lots of code here
//}

/// Or they might travel by bus.
///
//func commute(distance: Int, using vehicle: Bus) -> Void {
//    // Lots of code here
//}

/// Or they might use a bike, an e-scooter, a ride share, or any number of other transport options.
///
/// The truth is that at this level we don’t actually care how the underlying trip happens.
/// What we care about is much broader: how long might it take for the user to commute
/// using each option, and how to perform the actual act of moving to the new location.
///

/// This is where protocols come in: they let us define a series of properties and methods that
/// we want to use. They don’t implement those properties and methods – they don’t actually put
/// any code behind it – they just say that the properties and methods must exist, a bit like
/// a blueprint.
///
///For example, we could define a new Vehicle protocol like this.
///
/// Let’s break that down.
/// - To create a new protocol we write protocol followed by the protocol name. This is a new
///     type, so we need to use camel case starting with an uppercase letter.
/// - Inside the protocol we list all the methods we require in order for this protocol
///     to work the way we expect.
/// - These methods do not contain any code inside – there are no function bodies provided here.
///     Instead, we’re specifying the method names, parameters, and return types. You can also
///     mark methods as being throwing or mutating if needed.
///
protocol Vehicle {
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int
    func travel(distance: Int)
}

/// So we’ve made a protocol – how has that helped us?
///
/// Well, now we can design types that work with that protocol. This means creating new structs,
/// classes, or enums that implement the requirements for that protocol, which is a process
/// we call adopting or conforming to the protocol.
///
/// The protocol doesn’t specify the full range of functionality that must exist, only
/// a bare minimum. This means when you create new types that conform to the protocol
/// you can add all sorts of other properties and methods as needed.
///

/// For example, we could make a Car struct that conforms to Vehicle, like this.
///
/// There are a few things I want to draw particular attention to in that code.
/// - We tell Swift that Car conforms to Vehicle by using a colon after the name Car,
///     just like how we mark subclasses.
/// - All the methods we listed in Vehicle must exist exactly in Car. If they have slightly
///     different names, accept different parameters, have different return types, etc,
///     then Swift will say we haven’t conformed to the protocol.
/// - The methods in Car provide actual implementations of the methods we defined in the protocol.
///     In this case, that means our struct provides a rough estimate for how many minutes
///     it takes to drive a certain distance, and prints a message when travel() is called.
/// - The openSunroof() method doesn’t come from the Vehicle protocol, and doesn’t really
///     make sense there because many vehicle types don’t have a sunroof. But that’s okay,
///     because the protocol describes only the minimum functionality conforming types must have,
///     and they can add their own as needed.
///
/// So, now we’ve created a protocol, and made a Car struct that conforms to the protocol.
///
struct Car: Vehicle {
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        return distance / 50
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I'm driving \(distance)km.")
    }
    
    func openSunroof() -> Void {
        print("It's a nice day!")
    }
}

/// To finish off, let’s update the commute() function from earlier so that it uses
/// the new methods we added to Car.
///
/// That code all works, but here the protocol isn’t actually adding any value. Yes, it made us
/// implement two very specific methods inside Car, but we could have done that without adding
/// the protocol, so why bother?
///
func commute(distance: Int, using vehicle: Car) -> Void {
    if vehicle.estimateTime(for: distance) > 100 {
        print("That's too slow! I'll try a different vehicle.")
    } else {
        vehicle.travel(distance: distance)
    }
}

let car = Car()
commute(distance: 100, using: car)

/// Here comes the clever part: Swift knows that any type conforming to Vehicle must implement
/// both the estimateTime() and travel() methods, and so it actually lets us use Vehicle
/// as the type of our parameter rather than Car. We can rewrite the function to this.
///
/// Now we’re saying this function can be called with any type of data, as long as that type
/// conforms to the Vehicle protocol. The body of the function doesn’t need to change,
/// because Swift knows for sure that the estimateTime() and travel() methods exist.
///
func commute1(distance: Int, using vehicle: Vehicle) -> Void {
    if vehicle.estimateTime(for: distance) > 100 {
        print("That's too slow! I'll try a different vehicle.")
    } else {
        vehicle.travel(distance: distance)
    }
}

/// If you’re still wondering why this is useful, consider the following struct.
///
/// Now we have a second struct that also conforms to Vehicle, and this is where the power
/// of protocols becomes apparent: we can now either pass a Car or a Bicycle into the commute()
/// function. Internally the function can have all the logic it wants, and when it calls
/// estimateTime() or travel() Swift will automatically use the appropriate one – if we pass in
/// a car it will say “I’m driving”, but if we pass in a bike it will say “I’m cycling”.
///
struct Bicycle: Vehicle {
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        return distance / 10
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I'm cycling \(distance) km.")
    }
}

let bike = Bicycle()
commute1(distance: 50, using: bike)

/// So, protocols let us talk about the kind of functionality we want to work with, rather than
/// the exact types. Rather than saying “this parameter must be a car”, we can instead say
/// “this parameter can be anything at all, as long as it’s able to estimate travel time and
/// move to a new location.”
///

/// As well as methods, you can also write protocols to describe properties that must exist on
/// conforming types. To do this, write var, then a property name, then list whether it should be
/// readable and/or writeable.
///
/// For example, we could specify that all types that conform Vehicle must specify how many seats
/// they have and how many passengers they currently have, like this.
///
/// That adds two properties.
/// - A string called name, which must be readable. That might mean it’s a constant,
///     but it might also be a computed property with a getter.
/// - An integer called currentPassengers, which must be read-write. That might mean
///     it’s a variable, but it might also be a computed property with a getter and setter.
///
/// Type annotation is required for both of them, because we can’t provide a default value
/// in a protocol, just like how protocols can’t provide implementations for methods.
///
protocol Vehicle1 {
    var name: String { get }
    var currentPassengers: Int { get set }
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int
    func travel(distance: Int)
}

/// With those two extra requirements in place, Swift will warn us that both Car and Bicycle
/// no longer conform to the protocol because they are missing the properties. To fix that,
/// we could add the following properties to Car.
///
/// Again, though, you could replace those with computed properties as long as you obey the rules
/// – if you use { get set } then you can’t conform to the protocol using a constant property.
///
struct Car1: Vehicle1 {
    let name = "Car"
    var currentPassengers = 1
    
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        return distance / 50
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I'm driving \(distance)km.")
    }
    
    func openSunroof() -> Void {
        print("It's a nice day!")
    }
}

/// And these to Bicycle.
///
struct Bicycle1: Vehicle1 {
    let name = "Bicycle"
    var currentPassengers = 1
    
    func estimateTime(for distance: Int) -> Int {
        return distance / 10
    }
    
    func travel(distance: Int) {
        print("I'm cycling \(distance) km.")
    }
}

/// So now our protocol requires two methods and two properties, meaning that all conforming types
/// must implement those four things in order for our code to work. This in turn means Swift
/// knows for sure that functionality is present, so we can write code relying on it.
///
/// For example, we could write a method that accepts an array of vehicles and uses it to
/// calculate estimates across a range of options.
///
func getTravelEstimate(using vehicles: [Vehicle1], distance: Int) -> Void {
    for vehicle in vehicles {
        let estimate = vehicle.estimateTime(for: distance)
        print("\(vehicle.name): \(estimate) hours to travel \(distance) km")
    }
}

/// Hacking With Swift hope that shows you the real power of protocols – we accept a whole array
/// of the Vehicle protocol, which means we can pass in a Car, a Bicycle, or any other struct
/// that conforms to Vehicle, and it will automatically work.
///
let car1 = Car1()
let bike1 = Bicycle1()

getTravelEstimate(using: [car1, bike1], distance: 150)

/// As well as accepting protocols as parameters, you can also return protocols from a function
/// if needed.
///
/// You can conform to as many protocols as you need, just by listing them one by one separated
/// with a comma. If you ever need to subclass something and conform to a protocol,
/// you should put the parent class name first, then write your protocols afterwards.
///

/// Why does Swift need protocols?
///
/// Protocols let us define how structs, classes, and enums ought to work: what methods they
/// should have, and what properties they should have. Swift will enforce these rules for us,
/// so that when we say a type conforms to a protocol Swift will make sure it has all the methods
/// and properties required by that protocol.
///
/// In practice, what protocols allow us to do is treat our data in more general terms. So,
/// rather than saying “this buy() method must accept a Book object,” we can say “this method can
/// accept anything that conforms to the Purchaseable protocol. That might be a book, but it might
/// also be a movie, a car, some coffee, and so on – it makes our simple method more flexible,
/// while ensuring that Swift enforces the rules for us.
///

/// In code terms, our simple buy() method that works only with books would look like this.
///
struct Book {
    var name: String
}

func buy(_ book: Book) -> Void {
    print("I'm buying \(book.name)")
}

/// To create a more flexible, protocol-based approach we would first create a protocol
/// that declares the basic functionality we need. This might be many methods and properties,
/// but here we’re just going to say that we need a name string.
///
protocol Purchaseable {
    var name: String { get set }
}

/// Now we can go ahead and define as many structs as we need, with each one conforming
/// to that protocol by having a name string.
///
/// You’ll notice each one of those types has a different property that wasn’t declared
/// in the protocol, and that’s okay – protocols determine the minimum required functionality,
/// but we can always add more.
///
struct Book1: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var author: String
}

struct Movie: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var actors: [String]
}

struct Car2: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var manufacturer: String
}

struct Coffee: Purchaseable {
    var name: String
    var strength: Int
}

/// Finally, we can rewrite the buy() function so that it accepts any kind of Purchaseable item.
///
/// Inside that method we can use the name property of our item safely, because Swift will
/// guarantee that each Purchaseable item has a name property. It doesn’t guarantee that
/// any of the other properties we defined will exist, only the ones that are specifically
/// declared in the protocol.
///
func buy1(_ item: Purchaseable) -> Void {
    print("I'm buying \(item.name)")
}

let book1 = Book1(name: "Example Book1", author: "Example Author")
let movie = Movie(name: "Example Movie", actors: ["Example A", "Example B"])

items.append(book1)
items.append(movie)
items.append(car2)
items.append(coffee)

for item in items {
    buy1(item)
}

/// So, protocols let us create blueprints of how our types share functionality,
/// then use those blueprints in our functions to let them work on a wider variety of data.
///





/// How to use opaque return types
///
/// Swift provides one really obscure, really complex, but really important feature called opaque
/// return types, which let us remove complexity in our code. Honestly I wouldn’t cover it in
/// a beginners course if it weren’t for one very important fact: you will see it immediately
/// as soon as you create your very first SwiftUI project.
///
/// You don’t need to understand in detail how opaque return types work, only that they exist and
/// do a very specific job. As you’re following along here you might start to wonder why this
/// feature is useful, but trust me: it is important, and it is useful, so try to power through!
///

/// Let’s implement two simple functions.
///
/// Bool.random() returns either true or false. Unlike random integers and decimals, we don’t need
/// to specify any parameters because there are no customization options.
///
/// So, getRandomNumber() returns a random integer, and getRandomBool() returns a random Boolean.
///
func getRandomNumber() -> Int {
    Int.random(in: 1...6)
}

func getRandomBool() -> Bool {
    Bool.random()
}

/// Both Int and Bool conform to a common Swift protocol called Equatable, which means
/// “can be compared for equality.” The Equatable protocol is what allows us to use ==, like this.
///
print(getRandomNumber() == getRandomNumber())

/// Because both of these types conform to Equatable, we could try amending our function
/// to return an Equatable value, like this.
///
/// However, that code won’t work, and Swift will throw up an error message that is unlikely
/// to be helpful at this point in your Swift career: “protocol 'Equatable' can only be used
/// as a generic constraint because it has Self or associated type requirements”. What Swift’s
/// error means is that returning Equatable doesn’t make sense, and understanding why it doesn’t
/// make sense is the key to understanding opaque return types.
///
//func getRandomNumber1() -> Equatable {
//    Int.random(in: 1...6)
//}
//
//func getRandomBool1() -> Equatable {
//    Bool.random()
//}

/// First up: yes, you can return protocols from functions, and often it’s a really helpful thing
/// to do. For example, you might have a function that finds car rentals for users: it accepts the
/// number of passengers that it needs to carry, along with how much luggage they want, but it
/// might send back one of several structs: Compact, ‌SUV, Minivan, and so on.
///
/// We can handle this by returning a Vehicle protocol that is adopted by all those structs,
/// and so whoever calls the function will get back some kind of car matching their request
/// without us having to write 10 different functions to handle all car varieties. Each of those
/// car types will implement all the methods and properties of Vehicle, which means they are
/// interchangeable – from a coding perspective we don’t care which of the options we get back.
///
/// Now think about sending back an Int or a Bool. Yes, both conform to Equatable, but they aren’t
/// interchangeable – we can’t use == to compare an Int and a Bool, because Swift won’t let us
/// regardless of what protocols they conform to.
///
/// Returning a protocol from a function is useful because it lets us hide information:
/// rather than stating the exact type that is being returned, we get to focus on
/// the functionality that is returned. In the case of a Vehicle protocol, that might mean
/// reporting back the number of seats, the approximate fuel usage, and a price. This means
/// we can change our code later without breaking things: we could return a RaceCar, or
/// a PickUpTruck, etc, as long as they implement the properties and methods required by Vehicle.
///
/// Hiding information in this way is really useful, but it just isn’t possible with Equatable
/// because it isn’t possible to compare two different Equatable things. Even if we call
/// getRandomNumber() twice to get two integers, we can’t compare them because we’ve hidden their
/// exact data type – we’ve hidden the fact that they are two integers that actually
/// could be compared.
///

/// This is where opaque return types come in: they let us hide information in our code, but not
/// from the Swift compiler. This means we reserve the right to make our code flexible internally
/// so that we can return different things in the future, but Swift always understands the actual
/// data type being returned and will check it appropriately.
///
/// To upgrade our two functions to opaque return types, add the keyword some before their
/// return type, like this.
///
/// And now we can call getRandomNumber() twice and compare the results using ==.
/// From our perspective we still only have some Equatable data, but Swift knows
/// that behind the scenes they are actually two integers.
///
func getRandomNumber2() -> some Equatable {
    Int.random(in: 1...6)
}

func getRandomBool2() -> some Equatable {
    Bool.random()
}

/// Returning an opaque return type means we still get to focus on the functionality we want to
/// return rather than the specific type, which in turn allows us to change our mind in the future
/// without breaking the rest of our code. For example, getRandomNumber() could switch to using
/// Double.random(in:) and the code would still work great.
///
/// But the advantage here is that Swift always knows the real underlying data type. It’s a subtle
/// distinction, but returning Vehicle means "any sort of Vehicle type but we don't know what",
/// whereas returning some Vehicle means "a specific sort of Vehicle type but we don't want to say
/// which one.”
///

/// At this point I expect your head is spinning, so let me give you a real example of why this
/// matters in SwiftUI. SwiftUI needs to know exactly what kind of layout you want to show on the
/// screen, and so we write code to describe it.
///
/// In English, we might say something like this: “there’s a screen with a toolbar at the top,
/// a tab bar at the bottom, and in the middle is a scrolling grid of color icons, each of which
/// has a label below saying what the icon means written in a bold font, and when you tap an icon
/// a message appears.”
///
/// When SwiftUI asks for our layout, that description – the whole thing – becomes the return type
/// for the layout. We need to be explicit about every single thing we want to show on the screen,
/// including positions, colors, font sizes, and more. Can you imagine typing that as your return
/// type? It would be a mile long! And every time you changed the code to generate your layout,
/// you’d need to change the return type to match.
///
/// This is where opaque return types come to the rescue: we can return the type some View,
/// which means that some kind of view screen will be returned but we don’t want to have to write
/// out its mile-long type. At the same time, Swift knows the real underlying type because that’s
/// how opaque return types work: Swift always knows the exact type of data being sent back, and
/// SwiftUI will use that create its layouts.
///

/// Like Hacking With Swift said at the beginning, opaque return types are a really obscure,
/// really complex, but really important feature, and Hacking With Swift wouldn’t cover them
/// in a beginners course if it weren’t for the fact that they are used extensively in SwiftUI.
///
/// So, when you see some View in your SwiftUI code, it’s effectively us telling Swift
/// “this is going to send back some kind of view to lay out, but I don’t want to write out
/// the exact thing – you figure it out for yourself.”
///





/// How to create and use extensions
///
/// Extensions let us add functionality to any type, whether we created it or someone else
/// created it – even one of Apple’s own types.
///
/// To demonstrate this, I want to introduce you to a useful method on strings,
/// called trimmingCharacters(in:). This removes certain kinds of characters from the start
/// or end of a string, such as alphanumeric letters, decimal digits, or, most commonly,
/// whitespace and new lines.
///
/// Whitespace is the general term of the space character, the tab character, and a variety
/// of other variants on those two. New lines are line breaks in text, which might sound simple
/// but in practice of course there is no single one way of making them, so when we ask to trim
/// new lines it will automatically take care of all the variants for us.
///

/// For example, here’s a string that has whitespace on either side.
///
var quote = "   The truth is rarely pure and never simple   "

/// If we wanted to trim the whitespace and newlines on either side, we could do so like this.
///
/// The .whitespacesAndNewlines value comes from Apple’s Foundation API, and actually so does
/// trimmingCharacters(in:) – like I said way back at the beginning of this course,
/// Foundation is really packed with useful code!
///
let trimmed = quote.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)

/// Having to call trimmingCharacters(in:) every time is a bit wordy, so let’s write
/// an extension to make it shorter.
///
/// Let’s break that down.
/// - We start with the extension keyword, which tells Swift we want to add functionality
///     to an existing type.
/// - Which type? Well, that comes next: we want to add functionality to String.
/// - Now we open a brace, and all the code until the final closing brace is there to be added
///     to strings.
/// - We’re adding a new method called trimmed(), which returns a new string.
/// - Inside there we call the same method as before: trimmingCharacters(in:), sending back
///     its result.
/// - Notice how we can use self here – that automatically refers to the current string.
///     This is possible because we’re currently in a string extension.
///
extension String {
    func trimmed() -> String {
        return self.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    }
}

/// And now everywhere we want to remove whitespace and newlines we can just write the following.
///
/// Much easier!
///
var quote1 = "   The truth is rarely pure and never simple   "
let trimmed1 = quote1.trimmed()

/// That’s saved some typing, but is it that much better than a regular function?
///
/// Well, the truth is that we could have written a function like this.
///
func trim(_ string: String) -> String {
    return string.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
}

/// Then used it like this.
///
/// That’s less code than using an extension, both in terms of making the function and using it.
/// This kind of function is called a global function, because it’s available everywhere
/// in our project.
///
var quote2 = "   The truth is rarely pure and never simple   "
let trimmed2 = trim(quote2)

/// However, the extension has a number of benefits over the global function, including.
/// - When you type quote. Xcode brings up a list of methods on the string, including all
///     the ones we add in extensions. This makes our extra functionality easy to find.
/// - Writing global functions makes your code rather messy – they are hard to organize and
///     hard to keep track of. On the other hand, extensions are naturally grouped by the data
///     type they are extending.
/// - Because your extension methods are a full part of the original type, they get full access
///     to the type’s internal data. That means they can use properties and methods marked
///     with private access control, for example.
///

/// What’s more, extensions make it easier to modify values in place – i.e., to change
/// a value directly, rather than return a new value.
///
/// For example, earlier we wrote a trimmed() method that returns a new string with whitespace
/// and newlines removed, but if we wanted to modify the string directly we could add this
/// to the extension.
///
extension String {
    mutating func trim() -> Void {
        self = self.trimmed()
    }
}

/// Because the quote string was created as a variable, we can trim it in place like this.
///
/// Notice how the method has slightly different naming now: when we return a new value we used
/// trimmed(), but when we modified the string directly we used trim(). This is intentional,
/// and is part of Swift’s design guidelines: if you’re returning a new value rather than changing
/// it in place, you should use word endings like ed or ing, like reversed().
///
var quote3 = "   The truth is rarely pure and never simple   "
quote3.trim()

/// Previously I introduced you to the sorted() method on arrays. Now you know this rule,
/// you should realize that if you create a variable array you can use sort() on it to sort
/// the array in place rather than returning a new copy.
///

/// You can also use extensions to add properties to types, but there is one rule: they must only
/// be computed properties, not stored properties. The reason for this is that adding new stored
/// properties would affect the actual size of the data types – if we added a bunch of stored
/// properties to an integer then every integer everywhere would need to take up more space
/// in memory, which would cause all sorts of problems.
///
/// Fortunately, we can still get a lot done using computed properties. For example, one property
/// Hacking With Swift like to add to strings is called lines, which breaks the string up into an
/// array of individual lines. This wraps another string method called components(separatedBy:),
/// which breaks the string up into a string array by splitting it on a boundary of our choosing.
/// In this case we’d want that boundary to be new lines, so we’d add this to our string extension.
///
extension String {
    var lines: [String] {
        self.components(separatedBy: .newlines)
    }
}

/// With that in place we can now read the lines property of any string, like so.
///
let lyrics = """
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright
"""

print(lyrics.lines.count)

/// Whether they are single lines or complex pieces of functionality, extensions always have
/// the same goal: to make your code easier to write, easier to read, and easier to maintain
/// in the long term.
///

/// Before we’re done, Hacking With Swift want to show you one really useful trick
/// when working with extensions. You’ve seen previously how Swift automatically generates
/// a memberwise initializer for structs, like this.
///
struct Book2 {
    let title: String
    let pageCount: Int
    let readingHours: Int
}

let lotr = Book2(title: "Lord of the Rings", pageCount: 1178, readingHours: 24)

/// Hacking With Swift also mentioned how creating your own initializer means that Swift
/// will no longer provide the memberwise one for us. This is intentional, because a custom
/// initializer means we want to assign data based on some custom logic, like this.
///
/// If Swift were to keep the memberwise initializer in this instance, it would skip our logic
/// for calculating the approximate reading time.
///
struct Book3 {
    let title: String
    let pageCount: Int
    let readingHours: Int
    
    init(title: String, pageCount: Int) {
        self.title = title
        self.pageCount = pageCount
        self.readingHours = pageCount / 50
    }
}

/// However, sometimes you want both – you want the ability to use a custom initializer, but also
/// retain Swift’s automatic memberwise initializer. In this situation it’s worth knowing exactly
/// what Swift is doing: if we implement a custom initializer inside our struct, then Swift
/// disables the automatic memberwise initializer.
///
/// That extra little detail might give you a hint on what’s coming next: if we implement
/// a custom initializer inside an extension, then Swift won’t disable the automatic memberwise
/// initializer. This makes sense if you think about it: if adding a new initializer inside an
/// extension also disabled the default initializer, one small change from us could break all
/// sorts of other Swift code.
///

/// So, if we wanted our Book struct to have the default memberwise initializer as well as
/// our custom initializer, we’d place the custom one in an extension, like this.
///
struct Book4 {
    let title: String
    let pageCount: Int
    let readingHours: Int
}

extension Book4 {
    init(title: String, pageCount: Int) {
        self.title = title
        self.pageCount = pageCount
        self.readingHours = pageCount / 50
    }
}

/// When should you use extensions in Swift?
///
/// Extensions let us add functionality to classes, structs, and more, which is helpful for
/// modifying types we don’t own – types that were written by Apple or someone else, for example.
/// Methods added using extensions are indistinguishable from methods that were originally part of
/// the type, but there is a difference for properties: extensions may not add new stored
/// properties, only computed properties.
///
/// Extensions are also useful for organizing our own code, and although there are several ways
/// of doing this Hacking With Swift want to focus on two here: conformance grouping and
/// purpose grouping.
///
/// Conformance grouping means adding a protocol conformance to a type as an extension, adding all
/// the required methods inside that extension. This makes it easier to understand how much code
/// a developer needs to keep in their head while reading an extension – if the current extension
/// adds support for Printable, they won’t find printing methods mixed in with methods from other,
/// unrelated protocols.
///
/// On the other hand, purpose grouping means creating extensions to do specific tasks,
/// which makes it easier to work with large types. For example, you might have an extension
/// specifically to handle loading and saving of that type.
///
/// It’s worth adding here that many folks realize they have a large class and try to make it
/// smaller by splitting it into extensions. To be quite clear: the type is exactly the same size
/// it was before, it’s just neatly split up. This does mean it’s likely to be a little easier to
/// understand, but it doesn’t mean the class is any smaller.
///





/// How to create and use protocol extensions
///
/// Protocols let us define contracts that conforming types must adhere to, and extensions let us
/// add functionality to existing types. But what would happen if we could write extensions
/// on protocols?
///
/// Well, wonder no more because Swift supports exactly this using the aptly named protocol
/// extensions: we can extend a whole protocol to add method implementations, meaning that
/// any types conforming to that protocol get those methods.
///

/// Let’s start with a trivial example. It’s very common to write a condition checking whether
/// an array has any values in, like this.
///
let guests = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Peach"]

if guests.isEmpty == false {
    print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}

/// Some people prefer to use the Boolean ! operator, like this.
///
if !guests.isEmpty {
    print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}

/// Hacking With Swift not really a big fan of either of those approaches, because they
/// just don’t read naturally to Hacking With Swift “if not some array is empty”?
///
/// We can fix this with a really simple extension for Array, like this.
///
extension Array {
    var isNotEmpty: Bool {
        return isEmpty == false
    }
}

/// Xcode’s playgrounds run their code from top to bottom, so make sure you put
/// that extension before where it’s used.
///
/// Now we can write code that I think is easier to understand.
///
let guests1 = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Peach"]

if guests1.isNotEmpty == false {
    print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}

/// But we can do better. You see, we just added isNotEmpty to arrays, but what about sets and
/// dictionaries? Sure, we could repeat ourself and copy the code into extensions for those,
/// but there’s a better solution: Array, Set, and Dictionary all conform to a built-in protocol
/// called Collection, through which they get functionality such as contains(), sorted(),
/// reversed(), and more.
///
/// This is important, because Collection is also what requires the isEmpty property to exist.
/// So, if we write an extension on Collection, we can still access isEmpty because it’s required.
/// This means we can change Array to Collection in our code to get this.
///
/// With that one word change in place, we can now use isNotEmpty on arrays, sets, and
/// dictionaries, as well as any other types that conform to Collection. Believe it or not,
/// that tiny extension exists in thousands of Swift projects because so many other people find it
/// easier to read.
///
extension Collection {
    var isNotEmpty: Bool {
        return isEmpty == false
    }
}

let guests2 = ["Mario", "Luigi", "Peach"]

if guests2.isNotEmpty == false {
    print("Guest count: \(guests.count)")
}

/// More importantly, by extending the protocol we’re adding functionality that would otherwise
/// need to be done inside individual structs. This is really powerful, and leads to a technique
/// Apple calls protocol-oriented programming – we can list some required methods in a protocol,
/// then add default implementations of those inside a protocol extension. All conforming types
/// then get to use those default implementations, or provide their own as needed.
///

/// For example, if we had a protocol like this one.
///
protocol Person {
    var name: String { get }
    func sayHello() -> Void
}

/// That means all conforming types must add a sayHello() method, but we can also add
/// a default implementation of that as an extension like this.
///
extension Person {
    func sayHello() -> Void {
        print("Hi, I'm \(name)")
    }
}

/// And now conforming types can add their own sayHello() method if they want,
/// but they don’t need to – they can always rely on the one provided
/// inside our protocol extension.
///
/// So, we could create an employee without the sayHello() method.
///
struct Employee: Person {
    let name: String
}

/// But because it conforms to Person, we could use the default implementation we provided
/// in our extension.
///
let taylor = Employee(name: "Taylor Swift")
taylor.sayHello()

/// Swift uses protocol extensions a lot, but honestly you don’t need to understand them
/// in great detail just yet – you can build fantastic apps without ever using
/// a protocol extension. At this point you know they exist and that’s enough!
///

/// When are protocol extensions useful in Swift?
///
/// Protocol extensions are used everywhere in Swift, which is why you’ll often see it described
/// as a “protocol-oriented programming language.” We use them to add functionality directly to
/// protocols, which means we don’t need to copy that functionality across many structs and
/// classes.
///
/// For example, Swift’s arrays have an allSatisfy() method that returns true if all the items in
/// the array pass a test. So, we could create an array of numbers and check
/// that they are all even.
///
let numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16]
let allEven = numbers.allSatisfy { number in
    return number.isMultiple(of: 2)
}

/// That’s really useful, but wouldn’t it be more useful if it also worked on sets?
/// Sure it would, and that’s why it does.
///
let numbers1 = Set([4, 8, 15, 16])
let allEven1 = numbers1.allSatisfy { number in
    return number.isMultiple(of: 2)
}

/// The underlying principle is identical: pass each item in the array or set through a test you
/// provide, and if that returns true for all items then the result of the method is true.
///

/// How about dictionaries – can they use this too? Sure they can, and it works identically:
/// each key/value pair gets passed into the closure, and you need to return either true or false.
/// It looks like this.
///
let numbers2 = ["four": 4, "eight": 8, "fifteen": 15, "sixteen": 16]
let allEven2 = numbers2.allSatisfy { number in
    return number.value.isMultiple(of: 2)
}

/// Of course, the Swift developers don’t want to write this same code again and again, so they
/// used a protocol extension: they wrote a single allSatisfy() method that works on a protocol
/// called Sequence, which all arrays, sets, and dictionaries conform to. This meant
/// the allSatisfy() method immediately became available on all those types, sharing exactly
/// the same code.
///

/// How to get the most from protocol extensions
///
/// Protocol extensions are a power feature in Swift, and you’ve already learned enough to be able
/// to use them in your own apps. However, if you were curious and have some time to spare,
/// we could go off on a little tangent and explore them further.
///
/// This is definitely edging beyond beginner-level Swift, so please don’t feel under any pressure
/// to continue on – you’re welcome to skip to the next chapter at any point!
///

/// Still here? Okay, let’s try another protocol extension, this time a little more complicated.
/// First, we’ll write it as a simple extension on Int.
///
/// That adds a squared() method, which multiplies the number by itself to get the square
/// so that our above code will print 25.
///
extension Int {
    func squared() -> Int {
        return self * self
    }
}

let wholeNumber = 5
print(wholeNumber.squared())

/// If we wanted that same method on a Double without just copying the code across, we could
/// follow the same pattern we did with Collection: find a protocol that both Int and Double
/// adopt, and extend that.
///
/// Here both types share the Numeric protocol, because they are both numbers, so we could try
/// to extend that.
///
/// However, that code won’t work any more, because self * self can now be any kind of numbers,
/// including Double, and if you multiply a Double by a Double you definitely don’t get an
/// Int back.
///
//extension Numeric {
//    func squared() -> Int {
//        return self * self
//    }
//}

/// To solve this we can just use the Self keyword – I introduced that briefly when we looked
/// at referring to static properties and methods, because it lets us refer to the current
/// data type. It’s useful here because it means “whatever conforming type this method
/// was actually called on”, and looks like this.
///
/// Remember, self and Self mean different things: self refers to the current value,
/// and Self refers to the current type.
///
extension Numeric {
    func squared() -> Self {
        return self * self
    }
}

/// So, if we had an integer set to 5, our squared() function would effectively work like this.
///
//func squared() -> Int {
//    return 5 * 5
//}

/// There Self is effectively Int, and self is effectively 5. Or if we had a decimal set to 3.141,
/// squared() would work like this.
///
//func squared() -> Double {
//    return 3.141 * 3.141
//}

/// Want to go further?
///
/// If you’re still here, Hacking With Swift think it’s safe to say you want to keep exploring
/// protocol extensions even more, and who am I to disappoint? This is definitely just
/// for very curious folks, though – you really do not need to know the following in order
/// to start building apps with SwiftUI.
///

/// Still here? Okay, let’s start with a built-in protocol called Equatable, which is
/// what Swift uses to compare two objects using == and !=.
///
/// We can make our User struct conform to Equatable like this.
///
/// We don’t need to do any special work here, because Swift can make the Equatable conformance
/// for us – it will compare all the properties of one object against the same properties
/// in the other object.
///
struct User: Equatable {
    let name: String
}

/// And now we can compare two users.
///
let user1 = User(name: "Link")
let user2 = User(name: "Zelda")
print(user1 == user2)
print(user1 != user2)

/// We can go further: there’s a Swift protocol called Comparable, which allows Swift to see
/// if one object should be sorted before another. Swift can’t automatically implement this
/// in our custom types, but it’s not hard: you need to write a function called < that accepts
/// two instances of your struct as its parameter, and returns true if the first instance
/// should be sorted before the second.
///
/// As you learn more about Swift, you’ll learn that the < function can be implemented as
/// a static function that helps keep your code a little more organized.
///
/// So, we could write this.
///
struct User1: Equatable, Comparable {
    let name: String
    
    static func <(lhs: User1, rhs: User1) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name < rhs.name
    }
}

/// Our code is enough to let us create two User instances and compare them using <, like this.
///
let user3 = User1(name: "Taylor")
let user4 = User1(name: "Adele")

/// That’s neat, but the really clever thing is that Swift uses protocol extensions
/// to make the following work too.
///
/// That code is possible because Equatable lets us know whether user1 is equal to user2,
/// and Comparable lets us know whether user1 should be sorted before user2, and with those two
/// pieces Swift can figure out the rest automatically.
///
print(user3 < user4)
print(user3 <= user4)
print(user3 > user4)
print(user3 >= user4)

/// Even better, we don’t even need to add Equatable to our struct in order to get == to work.
/// This alone is fine.
///
/// Behind the scenes, Swift uses protocol inheritance so that Comparable automatically
/// also means Equatable. This works similarly to class inheritance, so when Comparable
/// inherits from Equatable it also inherits all its requirements.
///
struct User2: Comparable {
    let name: String
    
    static func <(lhs: User2, rhs: User2) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name < rhs.name
    }
}

let user5 = User2(name: "Taylor")
let user6 = User2(name: "Adele")

print(user5 < user6)
print(user5 <= user6)
print(user5 > user6)
print(user5 >= user6)

/// Anyway, this has been a massive tangent – don’t worry if it left your head spinning a little,
/// it’s just for curiosity and it will make more sense when you’re further on
/// with your Swift journey!
///





/// Summary: Protocols and extensions
///
/// In these chapters we’ve covered some complex but powerful features of Swift, but don’t feel
/// bad if you struggled a bit – these really are hard to grasp at first, and they’ll only really
/// sink in once you’ve had time to try them out in your own code.
///
/// Let’s recap what we learned.
/// - Protocols are like contracts for code: we specify the functions and methods that
///     we required, and conforming types must implement them.
/// - Opaque return types let us hide some information in our code. That might mean we want
///     to retain flexibility to change in the future, but also means we don’t need to write out
///     gigantic return types.
/// - Extensions let us add functionality to our own custom types, or to Swift’s built-in types.
///     This might mean adding a method, but we can also add computed properties.
/// - Protocol extensions let us add functionality to many types all at once – we can add
///     properties and methods to a protocol, and all conforming types get access to them.
///
/// When we boil it down to that these features seem easy, but they aren’t. You need to know
/// about them, to know that they exist, but you need to use them only superficially in order
/// to continue your learning journey.
