/// How to handle missing data with optionals
///
/// Swift likes to be predictable, which means as much as possible it encourages us to write code
/// that is safe and will work the way we expect. You’ve already met throwing functions, but Swift
/// has another important way of ensuring predictability called optionals – a word meaning
/// “this thing might have a value or might not.”
///

/// To see optionals in action, think about the following code.
///
/// There we create a [String: String] dictionary with two keys: Mario and Luigi. We then attempt
/// to read the value attached to the key “Peach”, which doesn’t exist, and we haven’t provided
/// a default value to send back in place of missing data.
///
let opposites = [
    "Mario": "Wario",
    "Luigi": "Waluigi",
]

let peachOpposite = opposites["Peach"]

/// What will peachOpposite be after that code runs? This is a [String: String] dictionary,
/// which means the keys are strings and the values are strings, but we just tried to read a key
/// that doesn’t exist – it wouldn’t make sense to get a string back if there isn’t a value there.
///
/// Swift’s solution is called optionals, which means data that might be present or might not.
/// They are primarily represented by placing a question mark after your data type, so in this
/// case peachOpposite would be a String? rather than a String.
///
/// Optionals are like a box that may or may not have something inside. So, a String? means there
/// might be a string waiting inside for us, or there might be nothing at all – a special value
/// called nil, that means “no value”. Any kind of data can be optional, including Int, Double,
/// and Bool, as well as instances of enums, structs, and classes.
///

/// You’re probably thinking “so… what has actually changed here? Before we had a String, and now
/// we have a String?, but how does that actually change the code we write?”
///
/// Well, here’s the clincher: Swift likes our code to be predictable, which means it won’t let us
/// use data that might not be there. In the case of optionals, that means we need to unwrap
/// the optional in order to use it – we need to look inside the box to see if there’s a value,
/// and, if there is, take it out and use it.
///

/// Swift gives us two primary ways of unwrapping optionals, but the one you’ll see the most
/// looks like this.
///
/// This if let syntax is very common in Swift, and combines creating a condition (if) with
/// creating a constant (let). Together, it does three things.
/// - It reads the optional value from the dictionary.
/// - If the optional has a string inside, it gets unwrapped – that means the string inside
///     gets placed into the marioOpposite constant.
/// - The condition has succeeded – we were able to unwrap the optional – so the condition’s
///     body is run.
///
if let marioOpposite = opposites["Mario"] {
    print("Mario's opposite is \(marioOpposite)")
}

/// The condition’s body will only be run if the optional had a value inside. Of course, if you
/// want to add an else block you can – it’s just a normal condition, so this kind of code is fine.
///
var username: String? = nil

if let unwrappedName = username {
    print("We got a user: \(unwrappedName)")
} else {
    print("The optional was empty.")
}

/// Think of optionals a bit like Schrödinger’s data type: there might be a value inside the box
/// or there might not be, but the only way to find out is to check.
///
/// This might seem rather academic so far, but optionals really are critical for helping us
/// produce better software. You see, in the same way optionals mean data may or may not be
/// present, non-optionals – regular strings, integers, etc – mean data must be available.
///
/// Think about it: if we have a non-optional Int it means there is definitely a number inside,
/// always. It might be something like 1 million or 0, but it’s still a number and is guaranteed
/// to be present. In comparison, an optional Int set to nil has no value at all – it’s not 0 or
/// any other number, it’s nothing at all.
///
/// Similarly, if we have a non-optional String it means there is definitely a string in there:
/// it might be something like “Hello” or an empty string, but both of those are different from
/// an optional string set to nil.
///
/// Every data type can be optional if needed, including collections such as Array and Dictionary.
/// Again, an array of integers might contain one or more numbers, or perhaps no numbers at all,
/// but both of those are different from optional arrays set to nil.
///
/// To be clear, an optional integer set to nil is not the same as a non-optional integer
/// holding 0, an optional string set to nil is not the same as a non-optional string that is
/// currently set to an empty string, and an optional array set to nil is not the same as
/// a non-optional array that currently has no items – we’re talking about the absence of any data
/// at all, empty or otherwise.
///
/// As Zev Eisenberg said, “Swift didn’t introduce optionals. It introduced non-optionals.”
///

/// You can see this in action if you try to pass an optional integer into a function that
/// requires a non-optional integer, like this.
///
/// Swift will refuse to build that code, because the optional integer needs to be unwrapped –
/// we can’t use an optional value where a non-optional is needed, because if there were no value
/// inside we’d hit a problem.
///
//func square(number: Int) -> Int {
//    number * number
//}
//
//var number: Int? = nil
//print(square(number: number))

/// So, to use the optional we must first unwrap it like this.
///
func square(number: Int) -> Int {
    number * number
}

var number: Int? = nil
if let unwrappedNumber = number {
    print(square(number: unwrappedNumber))
}

/// Before we’re done, I want to mention one last thing: when unwrapping optionals, it’s very
/// common to unwrap them into a constant of the same name. This is perfectly allowable in Swift,
/// and means we don’t need to keep naming constants unwrappedNumber or similar.
///
/// Using this approach, we could rewrite the previous code to this.
///
/// This style is a bit confusing when you first read it, because now it feels like
/// quantum physics – can number really be both optional and non-optional at the same time?
/// Well, no.
///
/// What’s happening here is that we’re temporarily creating a second constant of the same name,
/// available only inside the condition’s body. This is called shadowing, and it’s mainly used
/// with optional unwraps like you can see above.
///
/// So, inside the condition’s body we have an unwrapped value to work with – a real Int
/// rather than an optional Int? – but outside we still have the optional.
///
func square1(number: Int) -> Int {
    number * number
}

var number1: Int? = nil
if let number = number1 {
    print(square(number: number))
}

/// Why does Swift have optionals?
///
/// Swift’s optionals are one of its most powerful features, while also being one of the most
/// confusing. Their core job is simple: they allow us to represent the absence of some data –
/// a string that isn’t just empty, but literally doesn’t exist.
///
/// Any data type can be optional in Swift.
/// - An integer might be 0, -1, 500, or any other range of numbers.
/// - An optional integer might be all the regular integer values, but also might be nil –
///     it might not exist.
/// - A string might be “Hello”, it might be the complete works of Shakespeare,
///     or it might be “” – an empty string.
/// - An optional string might be any regular string value, but also might be nil.
/// - A custom User struct could contain all sorts of properties that describe a user.
/// - An optional User struct could contain all those same properties, or not exist at all.
///

/// Making that distinction between “it could be any possible value for that type” and “it could
/// be nil” is the key to understanding optionals, and it’s not easy sometimes.
///
/// For example, think about Booleans: they can be true or false. That means an optional Bool
/// can be true, false, or neither – it can be nothing at all. That’s a little hard to grasp
/// mentally, because surely something is always true or false at any given time?
///
/// This is also a bit confusing when you think about empty strings, “”. That string contains
/// nothing, but that isn’t the same thing as nil – an empty string is still a string.
///
/// When you’re learning, optionals can feel really painful – you might think Swift doesn’t need
/// them, you might think they just get in the way, and you might grind your teeth every time
/// you have to use them. But please trust me on this: after a few months they will make perfect
/// sense, and you’ll wonder how you survived without them!
///

/// Why does Swift make us unwrap optionals?
///
/// Swift’s optionals can either store a value, such as 5 or “Hello”, or they might be nothing
/// at all. As you might imagine, trying to add two numbers together is only possible if
/// the numbers are actually there, which is why Swift won’t let us try to use the values
/// of optionals unless we unwrap them – unless we look inside the optional, check there’s
/// actually a value there, then take the value out for us.
///

/// There are several ways of doing this in Swift, but one of the most common is if let, like this.
///
/// The getUsername() function returns an optional string, which means it could be a string or
/// it could be nil. I’ve made it always return a value here to make it easier to understand,
/// but that doesn’t change what Swift thinks – it’s still an optional string.
///
func getUsername() -> String? {
    return "Taylor"
}

if let username = getUsername() {
    print("Username is \(username)")
} else {
    print("No username")
}

/// That single if let line combines lots of functionality.
/// - It calls the getUsername() function.
/// - It receives the optional string back from there.
/// - It looks inside the optional string to see whether it has a value.
/// - As it does have a value (it’s “Taylor”), that value will be taken out of the optional and
///     placed into a new username constant.
/// - The condition is then considered true, and it will print “Username is Taylor”.
///

/// So, if let is a fantastically concise way of working with optionals, taking care of
/// checking and extracting values all at once.
///
/// The single most important feature of optionals is that Swift won’t let us use them without
/// unwrapping them first. This provides a huge amount of protection for all our apps, because
/// it puts a stop to uncertainty: when you’re handing a string you know it’s a valid string,
/// when you call a function that returns an integer, you know it’s immediately safe to use.
/// And when you do have optionals in your code, Swift will always make sure you handle them
/// correctly – that you check and unwrap them, rather than just mixing unsafe values with
/// known safe data.
///





/// How to unwrap optionals with guard
///
/// You’ve already seen how Swift uses if let to unwrap optionals, and it’s the most common way
/// of using optionals. But there is a second way that does much the same thing, and it’s almost
/// as common: guard let.
///

/// It looks like this.
///
func printSquare(of number: Int?) -> Void {
    guard let number = number else {
        print("Missing input")
        return
    }
    
    print("\(number) x \(number) is \(number * number)")
}

/// Like if let, guard let checks whether there is a value inside an optional, and if there is
/// it will retrieve the value and place it into a constant of our choosing.
///
/// However, the way it does so flips things around.
///
/// So, if let runs the code inside its braces if the optional had a value, and guard let runs
/// the code inside its braces if the optional didn’t have a value. This explains the use of else
/// in the code: “check that we can unwrap the optional, but if we can’t then…”
///
var myVar: Int? = 3

if let unwrapped = myVar {
    print("\(unwrapped)")
    print("Run if myVar has a value inside")
}

guard let unwrapped = myVar else {
    print("Run if myVar doesn't have a value inside")
    throw CancellationError()
}

/// Hacking With Swift realize that sounds like a small difference, but it has important
/// ramifications. You see, what guard provides is the ability to check whether our program state
/// is what we expect, and if it isn’t to bail out – to exit from the current function,
/// for example.
///
/// This is sometimes called an early return: we check that all a function’s inputs are valid
/// right as the function starts, and if any aren’t valid we get to run some code then exit
/// straight away. If all our checks pass, our function can run exactly as intended.
///

/// guard is designed exactly for this style of programming, and in fact does two things to help.
/// - If you use guard to check a function’s inputs are valid, Swift will always require you
///     to use return if the check fails.
/// - If the check passes and the optional you’re unwrapping has a value inside, you can use it
///     after the guard code finishes.
///

/// You can see both of these points in action if you look at the printSquare() function
/// from earlier.
///
func printSquare1(of number: Int?) -> Void {
    guard let number = number else {
        print("Missing input")
        
        // 1: We *must* exit the function here
        return
    }
    
    // 2: `number` is still available outside of `guard`
    print("\(number) x \(number) is \(number * number)")
}

/// So: use if let to unwrap optionals so you can process them somehow, and use guard let
/// to ensure optionals have something inside them and exit otherwise.
///
/// You can use guard with any condition, including ones that don’t unwrap optionals.
/// For example, you might use guard someArray.isEmpty else { return }.
///

/// When to use guard let rather than if let
///
/// Swift gives us an alternative to if let called guard let, which also unwraps optionals
/// if they contain a value, but works slightly differently: guard let is designed to exit
/// the current function, loop, or condition if the check fails, so any values you unwrap
/// using it will stay around after the check.
///

/// To demonstrate the difference, here’s a function that returns the meaning of life
/// as an optional integer.
///
func getMeaningofLife() -> Int? {
    return 42
}

/// And here’s that function being used inside another function, called printMeaningOfLife().
///
/// That uses if let, so that the result of getMeaningOfLife() will only be printed
/// if it returned an integer rather than nil.
///
func printMeaningOfLife() -> Void {
    if let name = getMeaningofLife() {
        print(name)
    }
}

/// If we had written that using guard let, it would look like this.
///
func printMeaningOfLife1() -> Void {
    guard let name = getMeaningofLife() else { return }
    
    print(name)
}

/// Yes, that’s a little longer, but two important things have changed.
/// - It lets us focus on the “happy path” – the behavior of our function when everything
///     has gone to plan, which is to print the meaning of life.
/// - guard requires that we exit the current scope when it’s used, which in this case means
///     we must return from the function if it fails. This is not optional: Swift won’t compile
///     our code without the return.
///

/// It’s common to see guard used one or more times at the start of methods, because it’s used
/// to verify some conditions are correct up front. This makes our code easier to read
/// than if we tried to check a condition then run some code, then check another condition and
/// run some different code.
///
/// So, use if let if you just want to unwrap some optionals, but prefer guard let if you’re
/// specifically checking that conditions are correct before continuing.
///





/// How to unwrap optionals with nil coalescing
///
/// Swift has a third way of unwrapping optionals? Yep! And it’s really useful, too: it’s called
/// the nil coalescing operator and it lets us unwrap an optional and provide a default value
/// if the optional was empty.
///

/// Let’s rewind a bit.
///
/// That reads a non-existent key in our captains dictionary, which means new will be an optional
/// string to set to nil.
///
let captains = [
    "Enterprise": "Picard",
    "Voyager": "Janeway",
    "Defiant": "Sisko",
]

let new = captains["Serenity"]

/// With the nil coalescing operator, written ??, we can provide a default value for any optional,
/// like this.
///
/// That will read the value from the captains dictionary and attempt to unwrap it. If the
/// optional has a value inside it will be sent back and stored in new, but if it doesn’t
/// then “N/A” will be used instead.
///
/// This means no matter what the optional contains – a value or nil – the end result is that
/// new will be a real string, not an optional one. That might be the string from inside
/// the captains value, or it might be “N/A”.
///
let captains1 = [
    "Enterprise": "Picard",
    "Voyager": "Janeway",
    "Defiant": "Sisko",
]

let new1 = captains1["Serenity"] ?? "N/A"

/// Now, Hacking With Swift know what you’re thinking: can’t we just specify a default value
/// when reading from the dictionary? If you’re thinking that you’re absolutely correct.
///
/// That produces exactly the same result, which might make it seem like the nil coalescing
/// operator is pointless. However, not only does the nil coalescing operator work with
/// dictionaries, but it works with any optionals.
///
let captains2 = [
    "Enterprise": "Picard",
    "Voyager": "Janeway",
    "Defiant": "Sisko",
]

let new2 = captains2["Serenity", default: "N/A"]

/// For example, the randomElement() method on arrays returns one random item from the array,
/// but it returns an optional because you might be calling it on an empty array. So, we can use
/// nil coalescing to provide a default.
///
let tvShows = ["Archer", "Babylon 5", "Ted Lasso"]
let favorite = tvShows.randomElement() ?? "None"

/// Or perhaps you have a struct with an optional property, and want to provide a sensible default
/// for when it’s missing.
///
struct Book {
    let title: String
    let author: String?
}

let book = Book(title: "Beowulf", author: nil)
let author = book.author ?? "Anonymous"
print(author)

/// It’s even useful if you create an integer from a string, where you actually get back an
/// optional Int? because the conversion might have failed – you might have provided an invalid
/// integer, such as “Hello”. Here we can use nil coalescing to provide a default value, like this.
///
/// As you can see, the nil coalescing operator is useful anywhere you have an optional and
/// want to use the value inside or provide a default value if it’s missing.
///
let input = ""
let number2 = Int(input) ?? 0
print(number2)

/// When should you use nil coalescing in Swift?
///
/// Nil coalescing lets us attempt to unwrap an optional, but provide a default value
/// if the optional contains nil. This is extraordinarily useful in Swift, because although
/// optionals are a great feature it’s usually better to have a non-optional – to have a real
/// string rather than a “might be a string, might be nil” – and nil coalescing is a great way
/// to get that.
///

/// For example, if you were working on a chat app and wanted to load whatever message draft
/// the user had saved, you might write code like this.
///
/// So, if loadSavedMessage() returns an optional with a string inside, it will be unwrapped and
/// placed into savedData. But if the optional is nil then Swift will set savedData to be an empty
/// string. Either way, savedData will end up being a String and not a String?.
///
//let savedData = loadSavedMessage() ?? ""

/// You can chain nil coalescing if you want to, although I don’t think it’s common.
/// So, this kind of code is valid if you wanted it.
///
/// That will attempt to run first(), and if that returns nil attempt to run second(),
/// and if that returns nil then it will use an empty string.
///
//let savedData = first() ?? second() ?? ""

/// Remember, reading a dictionary key will always return an optional, so you might want to use
/// nil coalescing here to ensure you get back a non-optional.
///
let scores = ["Picard": 800, "Data": 7000, "Troi": 900]
let crusherScore = scores["Crusher"] ?? 0

/// This is definitely a matter of taste, but dictionaries offer a slightly different approach
/// that lets us specify the default value for when the key isn’t found.
///
/// You can choose whichever you prefer – when reading dictionary values
/// there’s no real difference.
///
let scores1 = ["Picard": 800, "Data": 7000, "Troi": 900]
let crusherScore1 = scores1["Crusher", default: 0]





/// How to handle multiple optionals using optional chaining
///
/// Optional chaining is a simplified syntax for reading optionals inside optionals. That might
/// sound like something you’d want to use rarely, but if I show you an example you’ll see
/// why it’s helpful.
///

/// Take a look at this code.
///
/// That uses two optional features at once: you’ve already seen how the nil coalescing operator
/// helps provide a default value if an optional is empty, but before that you see
/// optional chaining where we have a question mark followed by more code.
///
/// Optional chaining allows us to say “if the optional has a value inside, unwrap it then…”
/// and we can add more code. In our case we’re saying “if we managed to get a random element
/// from the array, then uppercase it.” Remember, randomElement() returns an optional because
/// the array might be empty.
///
let names = ["Arya", "Bran", "Robb", "Sansa"]

let chosen = names.randomElement()?.uppercased() ?? "No One"
print("Next in line: \(chosen)")

/// The magic of optional chaining is that it silently does nothing if the optional was empty –
/// it will just send back the same optional you had before, still empty. This means the return
/// value of an optional chain is always an optional, which is why we still need nil coalescing
/// to provide a default value.
///
/// Optional chains can go as long as you want, and as soon as any part sends back nil the rest
/// of the line of code is ignored and sends back nil.
///

/// To give you an example that pushes optional chaining harder, imagine this: we want to place
/// books in alphabetical order based on their author names. If we break this right down, then.
/// - We have an optional instance of a Book struct – we might have a book to sort,
///     or we might not.
/// - The book might have an author, or might be anonymous.
/// - If it does have an author string present, it might be an empty string or have text,
///     so we can’t always rely on the first letter being there.
/// - If the first letter is there, make sure it’s uppercase so that authors with lowercase names
///     such as bell hooks are sorted correctly.
///
/// Here’s how that would look.
///
/// So, it reads “if we have a book, and the book has an author, and the author has
/// a first letter, then uppercase it and send it back, otherwise send back A”.
///
/// Admittedly it’s unlikely you’ll ever dig that far through optionals, but Hacking With Swift
/// hope you can see how delightfully short the syntax is!
///
struct Book1 {
    let title: String
    let author: String?
}

var book1: Book1? = nil
let author1 = book1?.author?.first?.uppercased() ?? "A"

/// Why is optional chaining so important?
///
/// Swift’s optional chaining lets us dig through several layers of optionals in a single line
/// of code, and if any one of those layers is nil then the whole line becomes nil.
///

/// As a simple example, we might have a list of names and want to find where they should be
/// placed based on the first letter of their surname.
///
/// There we use optional chaining with the dictionary value because names["Vincent"] might not
/// exist, and again when reading the first character from the surname, because it’s possible
/// the string could be empty.
///
let names1 = ["Vincent": "van Gogh", "Pablo": "Picasso", "Claude": "Monet"]
let surnameLetter1 = names1["Vincent"]?.first?.uppercased()

/// Optional chaining makes for a very good companion to nil coalescing, because it allows you
/// to dig through layers of optionals while also providing a sensible fall back if any of
/// the optionals are nil.
///
/// Returning to our surname example, we could automatically return “?” if we were unable to read
/// the first letter of someone’s surname.
///
let names2 = ["Vincent": "van Gogh", "Pablo": "Picasso", "Claude": "Monet"]
let surnameLetter2 = names1["Vincent"]?.first?.uppercased() ?? "?"





/// How to handle function failure with optionals
///
/// When we call a function that might throw errors, we either call it using try and handle errors
/// appropriately, or if we’re certain the function will not fail we use try! and accept that
/// if we were wrong our code will crash. (Spoiler: you should use try! very rarely.)
///
/// However, there is an alternative: if all we care about is whether the function succeeded or
/// failed, we can use an optional try to have the function return an optional value. If the
/// function ran without throwing any errors then the optional will contain the return value,
/// but if any error was thrown the function will return nil. This means we don’t get to know
/// exactly what error was thrown, but often that’s fine – we might just care if the function
/// worked or not.
///

/// Here’s how it looks.
///
/// The getUser() function will always throw a networkFailed error, which is fine for our testing
/// purposes, but we don’t actually care what error was thrown – all we care about is whether
/// the call sent back a user or not.
///
/// This is where try? helps: it makes getUser() return an optional string, which will be nil
/// if any errors are thrown. If you want to know exactly what error happened then this approach
/// won’t be useful, but a lot of the time we just don’t care.
///
enum UserError: Error {
    case badID, networkFailed
}

func getUser(id: Int) throws -> String {
    throw UserError.networkFailed
}

if let user = try? getUser(id: 23) {
    print("User: \(user)")
}

/// If you want, you can combine try? with nil coalescing, which means “attempt to get the return
/// value from this function, but if it fails use this default value instead.”
///
/// Be careful, though: you need to add some parentheses before nil coalescing so that Swift
/// understands exactly what you mean. For example, you’d write this.
///
enum UserError1: Error {
    case badID, networkFailed
}

func getUser1(id: Int) throws -> String {
    throw UserError.networkFailed
}

let user1 = (try? getUser(id: 23)) ?? "Anonymous"
print("User: \(user1)")

/// You’ll find try? is mainly used in three places.
/// - In combination with guard let to exit the current function if the try? call returns nil.
/// - In combination with nil coalescing to attempt something or provide a default value
///     on failure.
/// - When calling any throwing function without a return value, when you genuinely don’t care
///     if it succeeded or not – maybe you’re writing to a log file or sending analytics
///     to a server, for example.
///

/// When should you use optional try?
///
/// We can run throwing functions using do, try, and catch in Swift, but an alternative is
/// to use try? to convert a throwing function call into an optional. If the function succeeds,
/// its return value will be an optional containing whatever you would normally have received
/// back, and if it fails the return value will be an optional set to nil.
///
/// There are advantages and disadvantages to using optional try, but it mostly centers around
/// how important the error is to you. If you want to run a function and care only that
/// it succeeds or fails – you don’t need to distinguish between the various reasons why
/// it might fail – then using optional try is a great fit, because you can boil the whole thing
/// down to “did it work?”
///

/// So, rather than writing this.
///
//do {
//    let result = try runRiskyFunction()
//} catch {
//    // It failed
//}

/// You can instead write this.
///
//if let result = try? runRiskyFunction() {
//    print(result)
//}

/// If that’s what you wanted to do then you could just make runRiskyFunction() return an optional
/// rather than throwing an error, but throwing and using optional try does give us
/// the flexibility to change our mind later. That is, if we write a function that throws errors
/// then at the call site we can either use try/catch or use optional try based on what we need
/// at that point.
///

/// - Optionals let us represent the absence of data, which means we’re able to say
///     “this integer has no value” – that’s different from a fixed number such as 0.
/// - As a result, everything that isn’t optional definitely has a value inside, even if
///     that’s just an empty string.
/// - Unwrapping an optional is the process of looking inside a box to see what it contains:
///     if there’s a value inside it’s sent back for use, otherwise there will be nil inside.
/// - We can use if let to run some code if the optional has a value, or guard let to run
///     some code if the optional doesn’t have a value – but with guard we must always exit
///     the function afterwards.
/// - The nil coalescing operator, ??, unwraps and returns an optional’s value, or uses
///     a default value instead.
/// - Optional chaining lets us read an optional inside another optional with a convenient syntax.
/// - If a function might throw errors, you can convert it into an optional using try? –
///     you’ll either get back the function’s return value, or nil if an error is thrown.
///
/// Optionals are second only to closures when it comes to language features
/// folks struggle to learn.
